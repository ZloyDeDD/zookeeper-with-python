# Zookeeper with Python
## Learning outcomes
Help the local zoo take care of its animals by building a tool to keep an eye on them. Create your first program that works with your data.

## Description
Now it's time to make our project user-friendly. In this final stage, you'll make your software ready for the zoo staff to use. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted.

## Objectives
Your tasks at this point:
- Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.
- Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting exit should end the program.
- When the program is done running, it should print: See you later!
